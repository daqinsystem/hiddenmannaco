        <p class="content-text"><strong>Hidden Manna Company</strong> (HMC/HMCo.) is a limited company owned by Hidden Manna, their Chief Executive Officer, and managed by her executives.</p>
        <p class="content-text">Hidden Manna Company got their name from the Bible where <em>'hidden manna'</em> refers to <strong>bread</strong> as the company first wants to sell bread and its ingredients. HMC started in October 2022 at producing eggs from their farm and selling them in retail. Next, they decided to be independent from their water and power supply needs of their plantations and farms so they've built their own power plant and water reservoir. In December on the same year, HMC stopped their company's operations because of some internal issues.</p>
        <p class="content-text">After a long hiatus, Hidden Manna Company started their operations again in May 2023, and built a mill and a restaurant. While preparing for the opening of their restaurant business, they started selling flour and milk on the market first. It was so successful that they decided to stop selling eggs on retail, and also stop their plan on opeing a restaurant to sell breads. Instead, they focus on producing flour and on selling them on market after a lot of studies in encylopedia with their Chief Finacial Officer at that time, Marcus Sandberg. Because of that, HMC built more plantations and mills to produce more flour. <small><em>(To see our products, visit our <a href="https://www.simcompanies.com/company/0/Hidden-Manna-Company">company's profile</a>)</em></small></p>
        <p class="content-text">Now, Hidden Manna Company also invested on research and development of their products/ingredients: water, power, seeds, grains, and flour through the help of their now Chief Technical Officer, Mr. Sandberg. HMC will do more in the future now that they have their new Chief Finacial Officer, Katie Leslie.</p>
